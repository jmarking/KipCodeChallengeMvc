# Mvc Code Challenge

Project was initially created to complete a code challenge from Kip at BTS.

[Demo Website](http://mvcdemo.gottech.io/).  This link is my personal websit running on my Windows 2016 home server.

Website designed with VS 2017, and not sure if it will work with earlier versions of Visual Studio.  You will also need [.NET Core SDK v2.1.500 and .NET Core Runtime v2.1.6](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).  Other than that, a restore on NuGet packages should be all that's is needed to run.

Bonus: Self hosted example
